## Astronomaly: Protege applied to MGCLS

Repository to host a small website to show the unusual objects discovered by Astronomaly:Protege in the MGCLS data. Viewable at https://michellelochner.github.io/mgcls.protege/.

This repository also hosts some supplementary files from Lochner & Rudnick (2024). The catalogue of Protege's recommendations, including source coordinates and human score (where available) is provided in [the catalogue folder](catalogue/README.md), along with two zip files containing png cutouts, while the outputs from the hyperparameter optimisation experiments in the appendix can be found in [the appendix](appendix/README.md) folder.
